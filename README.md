The app loaded perfectly on both the Nexus 4 and Nexus 10. Unfortunately, your GitHub repository did not contain dependency files, so I was unable to view the image you added to the app. The text wrapping on the child page worked well when moving from a small phone to a large tablet. Unfortunately, there was a lot of wasted space on the tablet screen (although the navigation buttons scaled horizontally). Lastly, when putting the device in landscape, the navigation buttons were no longer visible.
